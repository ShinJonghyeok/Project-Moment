# Robot-Cameraman
Spring 2019 team project

Introduction :
Nowadays, with the trend of sharing moments, people started to take videos and photos of themselves more frequently. However, during some moments which we want to capture, there is no camera person.

Motivation :
Professionals, who love self-filming, have to take person to film their motions, so that camera person keeps the athlete in the cameraâ€™s focus. Some sportsmen have to take their friends for recording their practice, so that they can view their mistakes and improve some techniques. In family videos, frequently, some members are left out for filming their loved ones.

Solution :
Robot Cameraman which will make "YOU" always in the center of the focus.

Development objectives :
- Suitable hardware design of the Robot
- Human detection and movement tracking
- Smile detection and capturing
- Connection between SW modules and HW

Team(contributed work) :
Jonghyeok Shin (SW developer, Smile detection and capturing algorithm)
Shynar Torekhan (SW developer, Human detection and tracking algorithm)
Sunghyun Kim (SW developer, Connection between HW and SW components)
Kanghyeon Kim (HW developer, Robot hardware design and construction)
Seongbin Parck (HW developer, Robot hardware design and construction)
